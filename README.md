# Logistic Regression with Titanic Dataset using R

The dataset in question in question is the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview). We are going to perform some data preprocessing/cleaning and fit a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a passenger survivied the accident or not.

## 1. Load the dataset and some basic preprocessing

Combining the train set and test set, the raw data of the first 10 rows is presented above. Immediately there are a few things we can do:
  - Remove the columns that is not necessary for our analysis: **PassengerId**, **Name** and **Ticket**. 
  - Deal with missing data. We will discuss this in details in the section below.
  
### 1.1. Dealing with missing data

There are 4 columns with missing data: **Age**,**Fare**,**Cabin**,**Embarked**. **Cabin** has 1014 missing values in a total of 1309 data points. We remove this column because it is so sparse. **Embarked** is a categorical variable with 2 missing value, hence we impute with the most common value 'S'. **Fare**, on the other hand, is a numerical variable with one missing value, which we impute using the mean of the entire column to preserve the mean after imputation.

**Age** is a numerical value as well. But if we apply mean imputation we can see the distribution of Age changes drastically. This is because of high number of missing values.
