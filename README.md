# Logistic Regression with Titanic Dataset


The aim of this notebook is to use every trick that I know about Logistic Regression, from data preprocessing to feature selection and so on, to achieve performance that is comparable to other more powerful algorithms such as Random Forest. Through this I want to prove that there are a lot more to analysing a dataset than just using the most powerful algorithms out there.


## 1. Load the dataset and some basic preprocessing

The raw data of the first 10 rows is presented above. Immediately there are a few things we can do:
  - 1+1=2
  - 2+2=4
